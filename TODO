General :

        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes (bug 80204).
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (bug 126284).
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make session management work.
        - Make the build system cleaner.

Gnometris:
	- Make preferences changeable mid-game. The old drawing problems should
          be gone, but we should check for other things before re-enabling it.
        - Drag and drop backgrounds:
	  - Accepts gradients.
	  - Tile tileable backgrounds rather than scaling them.

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
